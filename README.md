# Exercise Fitness App

## Overview

The Exercise Fitness App is a full-stack MERN web application with CRUD functionality designed to help users discover, manage, and track their favorite exercises. In my previous careers as a firefighter and personal trainer, fitness is a huge part of my lifestyle. As a new software programmer, I want to share the joys of learning new exercises. This application provides a user-friendly interface for exploring a vast collection of exercises, saving personal favorites, and receiving personalized recommendations. The application follows a client-server architecture, utilizing React on the client side and Express with MongoDB on the server side.
